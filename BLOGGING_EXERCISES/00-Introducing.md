# Introducing

* **Goal**: Introduce yourself
* **Timeline**: Within the first week of you joining the lab
* **Length**: Approximately 500 words

The goal of this blogging project is to make sure that you're featured on the Whitaker Lab website.

The brief is very simple: **write a little about yourself**.

You can cover anything you'd like.
Make the blog as personal as you'd like.

Some suggested topics for you to cover:

* Your academic background
* Where you grew up
* The research question you're interested in
* A problem in the world that you're looking to solve
* Your favourite hobby
* What you're hoping to do in the Whitaker lab

***You don't have to cover all these points!***
They're just suggestions to get you started.

It would be great to have a couple of pictures in the blog.
Feel free to be as creative as you'd like.

To upload your blog post, follow the instructions in the [`_posts/blog/template.md`](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/whitakerlab.github.io/blob/master/_posts/blog/template.md) in the [whitakerlab.github.io website repo](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/whitakerlab.github.io).

The blog should be submitted as file in the [`_posts/blog`](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/whitakerlab.github.io/tree/master/_posts/blog) directory via a pull request.

If this is your first blog, you'll also have to add yourself to the [`_/data/authors.yml`](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/whitakerlab.github.io/blob/master/_data/authors.yml) file.
