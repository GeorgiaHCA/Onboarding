# Meet Three People Blog

* **Goal**: Meet people and start to build your community
* **Timeline**: Within the first week of you joining the lab
* **Length**: Approximately 500 words

The goal of this blogging exercise is to help you build some connections with the researchers and staff members at the Alan Turing Institute.

The brief is very simple: **talk to three people and write about 500 words about those conversations**.

You can ask whatever questions you'd like, and you're welcome to chat with anyone you come across (except for current members of the Whitaker lab).

Some suggested questions could be:

* What is data science to you?
* What are your research questions?
* What do you like about working at the Turing Institute?
* Who is your target audience?
* What are the most exciting parts of your job?

***You don't have to ask all of these questions!*** They're just suggestions to get you started.

It would be great to have some pictures of the people you speak with (remember to ask their permission!) and a little of your own voice and experience in the blog.
